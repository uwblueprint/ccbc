    body: `In Schwartz and Gagnon’s whimsical picture book, young Samuel lives a quiet life with their parents and a goldfish, Bubble, but they long for adventure. Samuel’s quiet home life stands in stark contrast to the kooky sounds that burst out of their babysitter Chloe’s home, where there is funky music, dog barks, and enough funny noises to make your head spin. Chloe works as a costume designer, and young readers will be delighted by the variety of outfits, including Victorian gowns and yellow bird suits, seen amongst her rows of costumes.

      After Chloe shows Samuel a new dazzling dress that she had been working on, Samuel reveals to Chloe that their real name is Simone, but they haven’t figured out how to tell their parents yet. This delightful story encourages children to defy traditional gender norms and explore their identity and serves as a wonderful resource for parents and teachers who want to start a conversation with young children about gender identity. Chloe’s unwavering support and acceptance of Simone’s identity is heartwarming, and one will end the text wishing that they could dance around Chloe’s house to music
      with her and Simone. Readers will also surely be delighted by Chloe’s furry companion, aptly named Piano for her black and white spots, who delivers a set of four puppies that Simone names Hamlet, Zeus, Neptune, and Little Miss. Despite their pleading, Simone’s parents at first refuse to adopt any of the boisterous new puppies, but after a considerate consultation with Chloe, Simone’s parents provide their
      child with an incredible gift—Little Miss!
      
      The book finishes on a beautiful note as Simone’s parents affirm their identity by calling them by their new name, and Simone assures readers that their home is no longer quiet but filled with dog barks.`,

    body: `Kenneth Oppel has done it again! From start to finish, the Bloom trilogy provides readers with an exhilarating adventure with nail-biting action scenes and unforgettable characters, further cementing Oppel’s status as one of the top authors currently writing for middle-grade and teen readers. In the first book, Bloom, readers meet Seth, Anaya and Petra, three teens who discover that they are immune to the effects of mysterious and deadly new plants that quickly wreak havoc after a rainfall delivers their seeds worldwide. The teens are eager to help overcome the devastating impact of these invasive plants but must also grapple with their own surprising physical changes.

      Danger and mistrust of those in authority follow our trio of protagonists into Hatch when a rainfall delivery of eggs arrives on earth, adding vicious creatures to the mix of already deadly consequences
      from the plants. Seth, Anaya and Petra band together as they are separated from their families and meet other teens who share their unique qualities. When Anaya receives a message that could hold the answer to the invasion of the plants and the creatures and why the teens are so unique, they realize that their lives and the lives of those they love are in far greater danger than they could have imagined.
      
      Book Three, Thrive, brings an onslaught of new characters who leave Seth, Anaya and Petra questioning their alliances. Although they are physically separated for much of this book, each member of the trio pushes their abilities to new levels and must make important sacrifices along the way as they fight to prevent the deadliest invasion yet.
      
      Like in all the best science fiction stories, the believability of this narrative stems from the strongly developed characters with whom readers connect and identify immediately. The alternating  perspectives of the three protagonists allow the reader to delve further into how each teen deals in their own way with the challenges they face. One of the central themes throughout the trilogy with which young readers will especially identify is trust. Can we trust our friends? Can we trust authority figures? Can we trust those who say they want to help us but who might have ulterior motives? Can we trust ourselves to do the right thing in a tough situation?
      
      In these books, Oppel has created a unique and fascinating world of science fiction and a story that highlights the painful challenges of growing up, making choices and discovering who we truly are. A
      must-read!`,
